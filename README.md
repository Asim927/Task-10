# Task-10
# KNN – Handwritten Digit Classification

## Objective
To classify handwritten digits using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and understand distance-based learning.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
- Sklearn Digits Dataset (load_digits)

## Why This Dataset?
The Sklearn Digits dataset is built-in, easy to use, and officially mentioned as the primary dataset for this task. It avoids external downloads like Kaggle MNIST.

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded digits dataset using load_digits()
2. Explored feature and label shapes
3. Visualized sample digit images
4. Applied train-test split
5. Scaled features using StandardScaler
6. Trained KNN model with K=3
7. Tested multiple K values (3,5,7,9)
8. Plotted Accuracy vs K graph
9. Generated confusion matrix
10. Displayed predicted digit outputs

## Deliverables
- Notebook
- Accuracy vs K plot
- Confusion matrix

## Final Outcome
This task demonstrates distance-based classification and hyperparameter tuning using KNN.
